# Vector Data Collection Walk-Through
This repo contains the scripts I used to generate my custom data set to teach an Anki Vector to identify another Anki Vector. Here I'll walkthrough process, obstacles and reccomendations if you plan on creating a dataset yourself. 


## Get Started

Install python 3.11.x or higher 

'''
python -m venv .venv 
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
''' bash 
Install all the pip packages:
''' pip install -r requirements.txt ''' bash


Then Configure two Anki Vector robots with the SDK following: https://github.com/mparekh99/Vector-Setup 
Look Here for more help:WIREPOD https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod/wiki/Installation 
SDK - https://github.com/kercre123/wirepod-vector-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file

Then simply run python datacollect.py on one Vector 
And in another terminal activate environment and run python moving.py with the other vector. 



## Reflection 

A big lesson I learned is that your model is only as your data. Initially I collected data: show pic:
